Lecture: Setting up a Cloud Server Development Environment
==========================================================

	To create your Cloud Server select "Playground" from the Linux Acad top menu selection.
	Choose a CentOS7 vm and go form there....
	
	
	Server created and credentials are:
		Username:	cloud_user 
	Temp. Password:	b64e7924db33d2b83c06 <-- changed after 1st login "su2k"
	
	IP Address
		Public IPv4		54.153.19.155 	<-- this IP will change at each reboot!
		Private IPv4	172.31.26.155 
				IPv6	2600:1f1c:2bf:6405:db37:4da4:f0d5:d010 
	
		Public Hostnames
			jara20001c.mylabserver.com
			jara20001d.mylabserver.com
	
	Auto Shutdown
	4:55 PM




Required Software Packages, Tools, and Files:
 git, wget, which, words (need file at /usr/share/dict/words)
 lsof, text editor of your choice, python 3.6.5


 
1. Installing Packages
The following commands are used on the cloud server to install the packages and files that we need. 
  $ sudo su -
  # yum update
  # yum groupinstall -y "development tools"
  # yum install -y lsof wget vim-enhanced words which htop
  # exit
  $
  
2. Configuring Git
From our user account (instead of root):

  $ git config --global user.name "Jeff Avendano"
  $ git config --global user.email "jara2000@gmail.com.com"



3. Customizing Bash
Downloading a bashrc file from the Linuxacademy "GitHub repository" and place it in your $HOME directory. 
This command will download the file, rename it, and place it in the proper directory:

Linuxacademy GitHub repository -> https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-python3-sysadmin

 $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-python3-sysadmin/master/helpers/bashrc -o ~/.bashrc
   

4. Customizing Vim  ,.. Like was done for bashrc above.

  $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-python3-sysadmin/master/helpers/vimrc -o ~/.vimrc
    
 

5. Create the GIT repo in your $HOME :

   $ mkdir sample ; cd sample
   sample $ touch file.txt
   
   sample $ git init   			<-- turn directory into a Git repository
   Initialized empty Git repository in /home/cloud_user/sample/.git/
   
   sample $ git add --all .		<-- means add every file that's underneath my current directory
   
   sample $ git status			<-- we have a new file "file.txtx" that hasn't been committed yet...
   # On branch master
   #
   # Initial commit
   #
   # Changes to be committed:
   #   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
   #
   #       new file:   file.txt
   #
   sample $
   
   
   
  sample $ git commit -m 'Added new file'
	[master (root-commit) a4dcc97] Added new file
	1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
	create mode 100644 file.txt
  sample[master] $


So now we have setup our Cloud server and installed some tools for our development purposes!
We will next install Python which we will compile from source and go from there.







Lecture: Installing Python 3 on CentOS 7
========================================

Download and Install Python 3 from Source

Here are the commands that we.ll run to build and install Python 3:

[root] $ yum install -y libffi-devel zlib-devel bzip2-devel openssl-devel \
ncurses-devel sqlite-devel readline-devel tk-devel gdbm-devel db4-devel \
libpcap-devel xz-devel expat-devel


Goto: http://python.org  
		>> Downloads  
		 >> Source code 
		  >> and select the "Gzipped source tarball" version you want (Copy link address)

		  
		  
[root ] $ cd /usr/src
[root ] $ wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/Python-3.6.4.tgz
[root ] $ tar xf Python-3.6.4.tgz
[root ] $ cd Python-3.6.4
[root ] $ ./configure --enable-optimizations
[root ] $ make altinstall						<-- Very important, this will not overwrite the built in python 
[root ] $ exit										Py2.x executable. It will create a new Py3 executable!
			back to regular user,..

Ensure that secure_path in /etc/sudoers file includes /usr/local/bin




Upgrade Pip (Might not be Necessary)
The version of pip that we have might be up-to-date, but it.s good practice to try to 
update it after the installation. We need to use the pip3.6 executable because we.re 
working with Python 3, and we use sudo so that we can write files under the /usr/local directory.


	$ sudo pip3.6 install --upgrade pip		<-- Pip is the package manager used when working with Python
	


	

	
	
Lecture: History & Benefits of Python
=====================================

Python 3 - 2008

Key Points About Python:

Object-Oriented Scripting Language.

Dynamic & strong typing system.
	Dynamic types are checked at runtime
	Strong types don.t change implicitly, can.t add 1 and "something".
	
Supports functional concepts like "map, reduce, filter" and list comprehension.

Whitespace delimited (no { or } around code blocks)

Pseudo-code like syntax

Extremely popular language used across many different disciplines (academia, data science, 
scripting, web development, etc.).

Large open source community and public package index (Pypi).

Runs on all major operating systems (historically more of a pain to run on Windows than 
Unix systems). Pre-installed on most *NIX systems (usually Python 2).

Supported by large companies such as Google & YouTube.

Consistently high on the Tiobe Index (one of the most searched programming languages). 
4th as of the time of recording this.

Placed in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey.s top 10 for Most Popular Programming Languages, 
Most Loved Programming Languages, and placed number 1 as the .Most Wanted Language. (meaning 
it.s the language that developers want to use the most).

	==========================


Lecture: Strings   
----------------
 https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str


A string is an object.
	1. An object can have a state
	2. An object can hold on to some behaviour that it can use, this behaviour on objects refers to 
	   functions that are attached to the object itself and these are called methods.

Some Methods:	.find    .lower   .upper
   
examples:
	>>> "double".find('s')      here we call a method on the string double ( . )
	-1							<-- false
	>>> "double".find('l')
	4
	>>> "double".find('e')
	5
	>>> "double".find('d')
	0
	>>>
	>>> "TeSting".lower()		<-- calling the method "lower"
	'testing'
	>>> 'Password123'.lower()
	'password123'
	>>>
	>>> 'Ha' * 4				<-- arithmetic operators + and *
	'HaHaHaHa'
	>>>

special chars:   \t     \n    ""   ''    \  <-Esc
	>>> print('Hey\tYou')
	Hey     You
	>>> 'Hey\tYou'
	'Hey\tYou'
	>>>
	>>> print('Hey\nYou')
	Hey
	You
	>>>
	>>> print('Hey\\You')
	Hey\You
	>>>
	>>> print("'Hey' you 'what are'")
	'Hey' you 'what are'
	>>>
	>>> print('"Hey" you "what are"')
	"Hey" you "what are"

	>>> print('Your's is awesome')			
	File "<stdin>", line 1					<-- yup! need to Esc it with a \
1		print('Your's is awesome')
					^
	SyntaxError: invalid syntax
	
	>>> print('Your\'s is awesome')			<-- now it works!
	Your's is awesome
	>>>

	
	
	

Lecture: Numbers (int and float)	
--------------------------------
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex
  
  +  /  -  *  %   //   **

str   int   float

Operation		Result
--------------  -------------------------------------
x + y			sum of x and y	 	 
x - y			difference of x and y	 	 
x * y			product of x and y	 	 
x / y			quotient of x and y	 	 
x // y			floored quotient of x and y 
x % y			remainder of x / y
-x				x negated	 	 
+x				x unchanged	 	 
abs(x)			absolute value or magnitude of x
int(x)			x converted to integer
float(x)		x converted to floating point
complex(re, im)	a complex number with real part re,1
				imaginary part im. im defaults to zero.
c.conjugate()	conjugate of the complex number c	 	 
divmod(x, y)	the pair (x // y, x % y)
pow(x, y)		x to the power y
x ** y			x to the power y





Lecture: Booleans and None
--------------------------
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing
	
	True  	False   None
	^		^		^
	
	>>> type(True)
	<class 'bool'>
	>>>

Lecture: Working with Variables
-------------------------------

	>>> my_str = "This is a simple string"
	>>> my_str
	'This is a simple string'
	>>> print(my_str)
	This is a simple string
	>>>
	>>> my_str += " testing"
	>>> my_str
	'This is a simple string testing'
	>>>
	>>> my_str = my_str + " testing"
	>>> my_str
	'This is a simple string testing testing'
	>>>
	
	

	
Lecture: Lists
--------------

 [ ]  .append    .remove    .pop

Sequence Types . list, tuple, range:
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range  
  
Lists
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list

	>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	>>> len(my_list)
	5
	
	>>> my_list[0:2]
	[1, 2]
	>>> my_list[:3]
	[1, 2, 3]
	>>> my_list[0::1]
	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	>>> my_list[0::2]
	[1, 3, 5]
  
Change a value in a list using the subscript equals operation: 
	>>> my_list[0] = "a"
	>>> my_list
	['a', 2, 3, 4, 5]

Example of a method that modifies the object that is calling the method:
	>>> my_list.append(6)
	>>> my_list.append(7)
	>>> my_list
	['a', 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]	

Lists can be added together (concatenated): 	
	>>> my_list + [8, 9, 10]
	['a', 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
	>>> my_list
	['a', 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
	>>> my_list += [8, 9, 10]
	>>> my_list
	['a', 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Items in lists can be set using slices also: 
	>>> my_list[1:3] = ['b', 'c']
	>>> my_list
	['a', 'b', 'c', 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
	
Removing items from a list based on value can be done using the .remove method: 
	>>> my_list.remove('b')
	>>> my_list
	['a', 'c', 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
	
Items can also be removed from the end of a list using the pop method: 
	>>> my_list = ['a', 'c', 'd']
	>>> my_list
	['a', 'c', 'd']
	>>> my_list.pop()
	'd'
	>>> my_list
	['a', 'c']

We can also use the pop method to remove items at a specific index: 
	>>> my_list.pop(0)
	'a'
	>>> my_list
	['c']
	



Lecture: Tuples
---------------

Sequence Types . list, tuple, range
	https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range

Tuples
	https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple
	
	
	>>> point = (2.0, 3.0)
	>>> point_3d = point + (4.0,)
	>>> point_3d
	(2.0, 3.0, 4.0)

	>>> x, y, z = point_3d
	>>> x
	2.0
	>>> y
	3.0
	>>> z
	4.0

More common in Python 2:	
	>>> print("My name is: %s %s" % ("Jeff", "Avendano"))
	My name is: Jeff Avendano



	
	
Lecture: Dictionaries (dicts)
-----------------------------

Dictionary
	https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict	


We create dictionary literals by using curly braces ({ and }), separating keys 
from values using colons (:), and separating key/value pairs using commas (,). 


	>>> ages = {'jeff': 25, 'jane': 21, 'tom': 29}
	>>> ages
	{'jeff': 25, 'jane': 21, 'tom': 29}
	>>>
	>>> ages['tom']
	29
	>>> ages['kayla'] = 21
	>>> ages
	{'jeff': 25, 'jane': 21, 'tom': 29, 'kayla': 21}
	>>> ages['kayla'] = 52
	>>> ages
	{'jeff': 25, 'jane': 21, 'tom': 51, 'kayla': 52}
	
	
Remove keys with "pop" method:
	>>> ages.pop('tom')
	51
	>>> ages
	{'jeff': 25, 'jane': 21, 'kayla': 23}
	
	>>> ages.keys()
	dict_keys(['jeff', 'jane', 'kayla'])
	>>> list(ages.keys())
	['jeff', 'jane', 'kayla']
	
	>>> ages.values()
	dict_values([25, 21, 23])
	
	>>> list(ages.values())
	[25, 21, 23]

Using dict: 
	>>> weights = dict(kevin=160, bob=240, kayla=135)
	>>> weights
	{'kevin': 160, 'bob': 240, 'kayla': 135}

	>>> colors = dict([('kevin', 'blue'), ('bob', 'green'), ('kayla', 'red')])
	>>> colors
	{'kevin': 'blue', 'bob': 'green', 'kayla': 'red'}



	

Lecture: Conditionals and Comparisons
-------------------------------------
	
Comparisons
	https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#comparisons
	
if/elif/else
	https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements
	

	
 "if"  will always be True or False
  
	>>> if False:
	...     print('was true')
	... else:
	...     print('was false')
	...
	was false

	
	>>> name = "Jefferson"
	>>> if len(name) >= 6:
	...     print('the name is long')					<-- first True statement so stops here!
	... elif len(name) == 9:
	...     print('name is 9 characters')
	... elif len(name) >= 4:
	...     print('name is 4 or more characters')
	... else:
	...     print('what a great name')
	...
	the name is long									<-- output

==========================================================================================================

Exercise: Creating and Displaying Variables
-------------------------------------------

first_name - Set to your first name
last_name - Set to your last name
age - Set to your age as an integer
birth_date - Set to your birthdate as a string
	

>>> first_name = ("Jeff")
>>> last_name = ("Avendano")
>>> age = 45
>>> birth_date = ("May 10 1974")
>>> print(f"My name is {first_name} {last_name}.\nI was born on {birth_date}, and I'm {age} years old.")
My name is Jeff Avendano.
I was born on May 10 1974, and I'm 45 years old.
>>>


Exercise: Creating and Displaying Variables
-------------------------------------------

Create a script that has a single variable you can set at the top called user. 
This user is a dictionary containing the keys:

'admin' - a boolean representing whether the user is an admin user.
'active' - a boolean representing whether the user is currently active.
'name' - a string that is the user.s name.

ie: user = { 'admin': True, 'active': True, 'name': 'Jeff' }


>>Using pycharm code below works fine.

	C:\Users\jara\PycharmProjects\Workspace\venv\Scripts\python.exe C:/Users/jara/PycharmProjects/Workspace/venv/elif.py
	ACTIVE - (ADMIN) Jeff
	
	Process finished with exit code 0

>>However from REPL it gives a SyntaxError on print statement :    print(var1 + user['name'])

user = { 'admin': True, 'active': True, 'name': 'Jeff' }
var1 = ""
if user['admin'] and user['active']:
    var1 = "ACTIVE - (ADMIN) "
elif user['admin']:
    var1 = "(ADMIN) "
elif user['active']:
    var1 = "ACTIVE - "
print(var1 + user['name'])



Exercise: Iterating Over Lists
------------------------------
Building on top of the conditional exercise, write a script that will loop through a 
list of users where each item is a user dictionary from the previous exercise printing
out each user.s status on a separate line. Additionally, print the line number at the 
beginning of each line, starting with line 1. Be sure to include a variety of user 
configurations in the users list.

User Keys:

'admin' - a boolean representing whether the user is an admin user.
'active' - a boolean representing whether the user is currently active.
'name' - a string that is the user.s name.
Depending on the values of the user, print one of the following to the screen when you run the script.

Print (ADMIN) followed by the user.s name if the user is an admin.
Print ACTIVE - followed by the user.s name if the user is active.
Print ACTIVE - (ADMIN) followed by the user.s name if the user is an admin and active.
Print the user.s name if neither active nor an admin.




Working code using pyCharm:
==========================

users = [
    { 'admin': True, 'active': True, 'name': 'Jeff' },
    { 'admin': True, 'active': False, 'name': 'Renelle' },
    { 'admin': False, 'active': True, 'name': 'Dave' },
    { 'admin': False, 'active': False, 'name': 'Mike' },
]

line = 1

for user in users:
    var1 = (f"{line} ")

    if user['admin'] and user['active']:
        var1 += "ACTIVE - (ADMIN) "
    elif user['admin']:
        var1 += "(ADMIN) "
    elif user['active']:
        var1 += "ACTIVE - "

    print(var1 + user['name'])
    line += 1
